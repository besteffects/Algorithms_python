AI action: Sure, let's solve the Die Hard problem using the tools provided. The goal is to measure exactly 4 liters of water using a small jug with a capacity of 3 liters and a big jug with a capacity of 5 liters.

### Initial State:
- Small Jug: 0L
- Big Jug: 0L

The invariants are:
1. Small Jug must contain 0 to 3 liters of water.
2. Big Jug must contain 0 to 5 liters of water.
3. The big jug must not contain exactly 4 liters.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Fill the big jug (B) with 5L:**
   - Small Jug: 0L
   - Big Jug: 5L

2. **Pour water from the big jug (B) into the small jug (S) until S is full or B is empty:**
   - Small Jug: 3L
   - Big Jug: 2L

3. **Empty the small jug (S):**
   - Small Jug: 0L
   - Big Jug: 2L

4. **Pour water from the big jug (B) into the small jug (S) until S is full or B is empty:**
   - Small Jug: 2L
   - Big Jug: 0L

5. **Fill the big jug (B) with 5L:**
   - Small Jug: 2L
   - Big Jug: 5L

6. **Pour water from the big jug (B) into the small jug (S) until S is full or B is empty:**
   - Small Jug: 3L
   - Big Jug: 4L

### Solution Found:
- The big jug now contains exactly 4 liters of water.

Let's simulate these steps with human-readable output:

1. **Initial State:**
   ```
   Small Jug: 0L
   Big Jug: 0L
   ```

2. **Action: Fill the big jug (B) with 5L.**
   - Current state:
     ```
     Small Jug: 0L
     Big Jug: 5L
     ```

3. **Action: Pour water from B to S until S is full or B is empty.**
   - Current state:
     ```
     Small Jug: 3L
     Big Jug: 2L
     ```

4. **Action: Empty the small jug (S).**
   - Current state:
     ```
     Small Jug: 0L
     Big Jug: 2L
     ```

5. **Action: Pour water from B to S until S is full or B is empty.**
   - Current state:
     ```
     Small Jug: 2L
     Big Jug: 0L
     ```

6. **Action: Fill the big jug (B) with 5L.**
   - Current state:
     ```
     Small Jug: 2L
     Big Jug: 5L
     ```

7. **Action: Pour water from B to S until S is full or B is empty.**
   - Final state:
     ```
     Small Jug: 3L
     Big Jug: 4L
     ```

Thus, the big jug now contains exactly 4 liters of water.
