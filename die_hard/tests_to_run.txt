Tests to run on your Die Hard AI assignment:
1. Check that AI actually calling your tools or tool with different actions one by one
2. Check that you see that it can find both solutions 3,4 and 0,4
3. Check that you see different paths taken in different runs
4. Check that AI reacts when action is not doing what it is supposed to (fill_big results in 0,3, etc, mess with it)
5. Check what happens when you ask AI to find the unreachable state ((1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4))
Bottom line - prove that there is intelligence behind the use of tools
