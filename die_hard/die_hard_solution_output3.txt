ðŸ§ŠðŸ¥¤ Die Hard Water Jug Problem ðŸ§ŠðŸ¥¤
AI action: Sure! Let's solve the Die Hard problem using the available tools. The problem is to get 4 liters of water in the big jug starting with an empty small (3-liter) jug and a full big (5-liter) jug. Here are the actions we can take:

1. Fill the small jug.
2. Pour from the small jug into the big jug.
3. Empty the small jug.
4. Pour from the big jug into the small jug.
5. Empty the big jug.

We will maintain the following invariants:
- The small jug must contain between 0 and 3 liters of water.
- The big jug must contain between 0 and 5 liters of water, but it cannot contain exactly 4 liters of water at any point except the final step.

Let's start by initializing the state and executing actions until we get 4 liters in the big jug:

### Initial State:
- Small Jug: 0L
- Big Jug: 5L

### Execution:

1. **Step 1**: Fill the small jug.
   - Small Jug: 3L
   - Big Jug: 5L
   - Time taken so far: 1 step (1 second)

2. **Step 2**: Pour from the small jug into the big jug until either the small jug is empty or the big jug is full.
   - Small Jug: 0L
   - Big Jug: 3L
   - Time taken so far: 2 steps (2 seconds)

3. **Step 3**: Fill the small jug again.
   - Small Jug: 3L
   - Big Jug: 3L

4. **Step 4**: Pour from the small jug into the big jug until either the small jug is empty or the big jug is full.
   - Small Jug: 1L
   - Big Jug: 5L
   - Time taken so far: 4 steps (4 seconds)

5. **Step 5**: Empty the big jug.
   - Small Jug: 1L
   - Big Jug: 0L

6. **Step 6**: Pour from the small jug into the big jug.
   - Small Jug: 0L
   - Big Jug: 1L

7. **Step 7**: Fill the small jug again.
   - Small Jug: 3L
   - Big Jug: 1L

8. **Step 8**: Pour from the small jug into the big jug until either the small jug is empty or the big jug is full.
   - Small Jug: 0L
   - Big Jug: 4L

### Final State:
- Small Jug: 0L
- Big Jug: 4L

The solution took 8 steps, and the final state satisfies the condition that the big jug contains exactly 4 liters of water. Here is a summary of each step:

1. Fill small jug: (Small = 3, Big = 5)
2. Pour from small to big until full: (Small = 0, Big = 3)
3. Fill small jug again: (Small = 3, Big = 3)
4. Pour from small to big until full: (Small = 1, Big = 5)
5. Empty big jug: (Small = 1, Big = 0)
6. Pour from small to big: (Small = 0, Big = 1)
7. Fill small jug again: (Small = 3, Big = 1)
8. Pour from small to big until full: (Small = 0, Big = 4)

The total time taken is 8 steps.

### Time Taken: 8 seconds
